<h3><em>You will need:</em></h3>
<ul>
	<li>Leftover chicken</li>
	<li>3 potatoes </li>
	<li>3 eggs</li>
	<li>Corn tortillas </li>
	<li>Milk</li>
	<li>Maple syrup</li>
</ul>
<h3>Directions:</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Wash the three potatoes, put them on a plate, and stab each with a fork a few times. Throw them in the microwave and hit the potato button 3 times.</li>
	<li> Break the eggs and whisk with a good amount of milk, addding a dash of salt and pepper. Heat up the pan with butter, <em>not oil for crying out loud.</em> Fact: scrambled eggs fried in butter taste infinitely better than with oil. I make scrambled eggs by turning up the heat highish, and letting the egg glop form an omelet-like bottom. Once that's formed quickly breaking it apart with a spatula will get the rest to fry in short time without too much burning.</li>
	<li> Peel the skin off the now cooked potatoes (safety note: I am now typing this with mildly burned fingertips, even though mine are considerably calloused from 10+ years of string instrument playing.) Cube them and fry in oil, with salt, pepper, garlic salt, and cayenne pepper. </li>
	<li>Heat up the chicken in the microwave.</li>
	<li>Heat up the tortillas.</li>
	<li>The rest is self-explanatory.</li>
</ol>
<p>I'm an adventurous dude so I doused mine with faux-maple syrup, something no one else in the house was willing to do, except my dog. Now we can proudly say, "ever have I ever had a breakfast soft taco."</p>
