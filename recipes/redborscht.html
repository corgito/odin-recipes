	<h1>Red Borscht Ukrainian Homestyle</h1>
	<p><em>First published: February 2nd, 2013</em></p>
	<p>First off I know a lot of clowns the world over call it 'borscht', but in my mind this incredible soup always has been and always will be <em>'barszcz czerwony'</em>. Traditionally barszcz is done two ways: strained with pierogi in Poland, or unstrained with sour cream Ukrainian/Russian style. When I spend time in Poland my Ukrainian grandma always fixes it her way, so veggies it is.</p>
	<p>Barszcz is simple to make but fairly labor-intensive. Go down to the store and pick up 4-5 smaller, younger beets, or one of the giant ones. The younger beets are easier to peel and chop, plus I think they've got better color, but either will do. Also pick up a head of cabbage, parsley, carrots, celery, a medium onion, and a little can of tomato paste. along with a container of beef, chicken or vegetable stock, whichever you prefer and to taste.</p>
	<p>First: Peel the beets and chop them into slivers. I think this is called 'julienning' but I just recklessly hack at the beets until they're satisfactorily thin. Once they're chopped, throw the beets in a pan with some olive oil and half the container of tomato paste and let the suckers fry for 15-20 minutes over medium heat, stirring regularly so the paste doesn't burn.</p>

	<p>Mix the broth and water in a stockpot, enough to make two liters (half a gallon for you Imperial troglodytes), and season with a bit of salt and pepper, to taste. Stick the pot on medium-high heat, enough to get it to a comfortable boil.</p>

	<p>Now dice the onion, and cut up two each of celery sticks and carrots. Chop up the parsley. Fry all these ingredients with a bit of oil and the rest of the paste over a medium-low heat. The goal is to sweeten up the onions, not grill them, and soften the vegetables. This should take about 7 or 8 minutes. Once that's done, dump the veggies in the pot. By now the barszcz should have a pleasing red tinge, with a little foam on the top. Don't bother skimming that off. Let the soup do its thing for 25 or so more minutes. At this point you can season the soup to taste. I recommend adding a few bay leaves, fresh ground black pepper or peppercorns, salt, a bit of sugar, and a few cloves of garlic. Go nuts. There's no correct way to make this dish beyond the base of cabbage, potatoes, and beets, and most families/cultures have their own distinct variations.</p>

	<p>Once all the vegetables are soft, the soup's almost ready. It's a good idea to let the pot sit for a few hours, ideally overnight on a countertop. This allows the flavors to thoroughly blend, and most cabbage-based dishes taste better after a few hours or even days. After the first night, you can let the barszcz sit in the fridge overnight and reheat the next morning, at which point it'll taste even better. </p>
